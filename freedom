as a senior devOps engineer, one of the projects I am really proud of was the Kubernetes project Recently our tax to set up an ETS cluster In the past we have used Kubeadm. but this time around 
I was assigned a ticket to set up an eks-cluster to help our production environment. The goal was to enhance our automation, scalability, and maintainability in our Kubernetes infrastructure.
excited to go with the terraform option because of his benefits and the infrastructure brings to the table. I wrote my telephone scripts including Terror for models of variables Everything that needed to be passed as variables 
where passed as variables and with the help of Terraform I was able to set up production-grade Ek's cluster I did not just stop there so what I did
 I added what you call terraform Jenkinsfile so I have a Jenkins file.  In Jenkins, I'm able to trigger a job that is going to run in my terraform server meaning my terraform 
server is now configured as a Jenkins slave so from Jenkins I can now deploy an entire EKS Cluster in AWS. When I was done with the project my manager called it automation on automation, Terraform brought automation to the table
